# Page 1 - 31 de outubro de 2022 - Addictions and Discipline

I trully feel addicted to youtube.

  I am addicted to playing video games.

  I am addicted to porn, at this point.

  And I have awful discipline to boot.

  And zero punctuallity.

  Some degree of organization, but I always get distracted very easily.

Things to do (that I remembered today)

  I still need to figure out a way to use netrw, the neovim file-manager to work 100% from the terminal.

  I still gotta print all that stuff to my dad from the email he sent me.

  I still gotta launch my hours in the project, on maida and gama.

  I still gotta workout.

Things I got done

  Closed two tickets at my job today.

  Started this journal.

Final Thoughts

  There has to be a better way to organize my thoughts in a virtual journal. Folds in nvim are pretty helpful. I should learn how to use *bookmarks*.

  I should ground myself more.

  Remember that I am inside my bedroom. Stop listening to video, or music. Just listen to the noise outside. The wind, the trees, the people. Stop.

  When I feel an addiction coming, I should also stop, and ground myself.
