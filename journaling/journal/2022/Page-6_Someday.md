  Yes I am thinking about the _Someday song from The World Ends With You_

  I also just realized the importance of fresh air where I work. It makes invisible things clearer in the sense that even if I am not thinking about anything in particular at the moment, I feel my mind lighter and it is easier to think. The flow of my thoughts is intertwined with the wind I feel in my skin.

  My mind doesn't feel tired anymore. Well, the coffee might have helped.

  *My biggest problems right now are*

  + My discipline

    I am still horrible at *creating* and *keeping track* of habits. Such as writting here, working regularly on projects. My mind feels tired when I am not on coffee.

  + My lack of stopping to think alone

  + My focus / concentration

  *Missions*

  I've gotta create a simple way of keeping track of my stuff and think about it regularly.

  Description: I am living like I am on vacation. I am still at High School on life (22 years old). This is when I build the man I will be at 30, and there is nothing serious to it yet. I am living it like a vacation when I am in fact, very far from it.
