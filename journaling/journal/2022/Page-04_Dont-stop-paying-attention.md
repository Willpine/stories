# Page 4 - Don't stop paying attention until it ends

  + Attention and Hope

  I am waiting for the "Right time to start doing stuff". There isn't any right time besides *RIGHT NOW*. If I wanna do it, then I have to think about it instead of waiting for it. Waiting for exactly a round time is wrong. I've gotta start to think about it as soon as it gets to me.

  If I don't feel like it or my head is in the wrong place at the time, I've gotta write about it and then move myself. Some walking in circles and push-ups should do the trick.

  *Avoid Coffee at all costs*.
  
  + My speed & Discipline

  Today I slowed down considerably since Entry 3. Mostly because Youtube again, but 100% because I simply went against myself and turned it on just cause I wanted to.

  I think I did it.

  + Tracking myself

  This is a good way to collect my thoughts and organize myself. I have a lot to think about and it is literally impossible to get all the information I want all at once. I may even not read this in the future, but it helps in the present so I can plan better and understand stuff as of right now.

  The Simple act of having to think about what to write and what I should be tracking, makes me remember and connect everything else.

  - Apollo 85

  Watching the 2008 tour - Flight 666, Seeing Iron Maiden traveling the world with their own plane, inspired me to create a *FUTURISTIC INTERPLANETARY BAND THAT TRAVELS WITH THEIR OWN ROCKET*. Imagine how cool it would be to have a Science Fiction Rockband on tour.

  The Tour would be titled Apollo 85, cause the Flight 666 was a homage to the 1985 tour. In lore, it's because the Tour was done in 2085.
