I could go faster

  I really could. I could code faster, write faster, excercise faster, deliver faster, chat faster.

  But I distract myself easily.

  I also choose what I want instead of what I need to do, thinking I can always do both.

  I have to stop that. To discipline myself to get things done progressively without complaining.

I will go faster

  Starting today. When he says Go Speed Go, he is remembering himself he can always go faster. No max speed. Always faster and faster. Higher and Higher.

  Faster.

Desabafo

  I really could. Right now, I stink, my sleep schedule is way off and there is a world of things I still haven't done.

  But hey, on the bright side, I've managed to start a journal in markdown with proper folding and without plugins.

  My fingers hurt from the cold and from having to type this much.
