# Page 7 - Coloring and Noting

  **Fast Coloring:** 

    1. Grayscale and Color Layer / Alternatively just flat

    2. Multiply layer for shadows - Select color and don't change anything. Maybe shift the HUE.

    3. Overlay layer for highlights - Again, don't change anything. May shift hue or choose white in some cases.

    4. Color Dodge for added Saturation and effects.

  **About note taking:**

    I still haven't figured out a way to:

      + Make a schedule I can easily pull up and alter from anywhere or not forget exists.

      + Keep track of something I am learning - projects, plans.

    For the schedule part, *I obviously need a calendar*. I should stop depending on my cellphone to organize my day.

    I should have the entire day inside my head once I read it.

    For the tracking part, *I need something akin to a notebook*. This vim file is the farthest I've come to something Like that. Maybe I already found one solution.

    Do I wanna draw when I take notes? Yes! Then how am I gonna do this on vim?
    
    Should I default to notebooks? They are very practical. Yes!

    I will take notes on a notebook.
