# Juniper Maison

  Anna is a kid at heart. She will always see good in every situation. Her character is a study on what love means and how it affect us. Compassion and Empathy paired with a logical mind will flourish love.

  Understanding concepts, how others think.

  Youthful hope and optimism. Desperate, melancolic optimism.

- "No matter how far we travel, autumn will always feel like home".

- "We are beneath the same stars, even if we can't see them."

- "I miss them."
