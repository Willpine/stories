# Exhibition

Two brothers go to a museum.

One of them goes down a "lost" section.

He starts noticing stuff he recognizes from his past.

The memories start getting more vivid.

He enters his childhood parents house kitchen, before all renovations.

He realizes everything is **just like he remembers**, therefore **this can't be real**.

When he tries to leave the room, he starts to forget everything and almost gets lost inside his own memories.

He tries to remember the present day, moments before entering the room, and remembers the exit.

Leaves and finds his brother, looking back and sees a slightly different door than the one he got through.

Brother asks where he was and whats back there. Answers some old stuff and remarks they have to hurry to enjoy what remains of the day together before it ends.
