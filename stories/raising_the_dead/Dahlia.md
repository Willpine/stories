# Dahlia

The principal

## Background

Dahlia was liked by everyone on class and was the one to discourse at graduation.

She was best friends with a girl from her class named Clara Redmond.

She was the only survivor from the accident that killed a class of 28 graduates, save of course for her.

After that, all grieving parents sued the school and the agency behind the trip and it closed.

Dahlia always wrote on her diary about Clara, and started dreaming with her.

She lived her life normally, believing she got over the past, even becoming a history teacher at Maple District Founder's High School.
