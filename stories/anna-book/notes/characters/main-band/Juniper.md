  Anna is a kid at heart. She will always see good in every situation. Her character is a study on what love means and how it affect us. Compassion and Empathy paired with a logical mind will flourish love.

  Understanding concepts, how others think.

  Youthful hope and optimism. Desperate, melancolic optimism.
