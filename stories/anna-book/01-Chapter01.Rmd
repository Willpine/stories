# Newcomer to an old Neighbourhood

  After 3 hours of Galaxy Radio on the highway, we're finally at our old family house. This time we're staying a while, maybe for good.
  
  Usually me and my parents don't stay more than an hour on the road during our trips, so this one really did a number on us. My mom and I are feeling our legs tremble with each of its muscles hurting as we try to head to the house, while my dad has already rushed to the front door desperate for a toilet, not even bothered by his legs or the keys to the house he left in the car.
