## Page 1 - Addictions and Discipline 31/10/2022

  I trully feel addicted to youtube.

    I am addicted to playing video games.

    I am addicted to porn, at this point.

    And I have awful discipline to boot.

    And zero punctuallity.

    Some degree of organization, but I always get distracted very easily.

  Things to do (that I remembered today)

    I still need to figure out a way to use netrw, the neovim file-manager to work 100% from the terminal.

    I still gotta print all that stuff to my dad from the email he sent me.

    I still gotta launch my hours in the project, on maida and gama.

    I still gotta workout.

  Things I got done

    Closed two tickets at my job today.

    Started this journal.

  Final Thoughts

    There has to be a better way to organize my thoughts in a virtual journal. Folds in nvim are pretty helpful. I should learn how to use *bookmarks*.

    I should ground myself more.

    Remember that I am inside my bedroom. Stop listening to video, or music. Just listen to the noise outside. The wind, the trees, the people. Stop.

    When I feel an addiction coming, I should also stop, and ground myself.

## Page 2 - Addictions/Discipline update and the meaning of Life 03/11/2022

  I could go faster

    I really could. I could code faster, write faster, excercise faster, deliver faster, chat faster.

    But I distract myself easily.

    I also choose what I want instead of what I need to do, thinking I can always do both.

    I have to stop that. To discipline myself to get things done progressively without complaining.

  I will go faster

    Starting today. When he says Go Speed Go, he is remembering himself he can always go faster. No max speed. Always faster and faster. Higher and Higher.

    Faster.

  Desabafo

    I really could. Right now, I stink, my sleep schedule is way off and there is a world of things I still haven't done.

    But hey, on the bright side, I've managed to start a journal in markdown with proper folding and without plugins.

    My fingers hurt from the cold and from having to type this much.

## Page 3 - My speed and Some ideas 04/11/2022

  My Speed

    Today I did things a little faster. I am still far from my best, but it's a start.

  Some Ideas Like

    Writing everything in markdown and create scripts that upload them to notion, and other note taking apps.

## Page 4 - Don't stop paying attention until it ends

  + Attention and Hope

    I am waiting for the "Right time to start doing stuff". There isn't any right time besides *RIGHT NOW*. If I wanna do it, then I have to think about it instead of waiting for it. Waiting for exactly a round time is wrong. I've gotta start to think about it as soon as it gets to me.

    If I don't feel like it or my head is in the wrong place at the time, I've gotta write about it and then move myself. Some walking in circles and push-ups should do the trick.

    *Avoid Coffee at all costs*.
  
  + My speed & Discipline

    Today I slowed down considerably since Entry 3. Mostly because Youtube again, but 100% because I simply went against myself and turned it on just cause I wanted to.

    I think I did it.

  + Tracking myself

    This is a good way to collect my thoughts and organize myself. I have a lot to think about and it is literally impossible to get all the information I want all at once. I may even not read this in the future, but it helps in the present so I can plan better and understand stuff as of right now.

    The Simple act of having to think about what to write and what I should be tracking, makes me remember and connect everything else. 

  + Action Dump

    Talk to dario;

    Make a beat on waveform;

    Make an intro for willpine;

    Finish the TF2 Video;

    Setup another arch dist;

    Setup Simple minimalistic website prototype;

    Update Linkedin Entire profile and be more active there;

    Finish the *GodSpeed* song;

    Write a Story about something I like;

  + Thought Dump

    I love fast paced Jazz.

  + Idea Dump

    - Apollo 85

      Watching the 2008 tour - Flight 666, Seeing Iron Maiden traveling the world with their own plane, inspired me to create a *FUTURISTIC INTERPLANETARY BAND THAT TRAVELS WITH THEIR OWN ROCKET*. Imagine how cool it would be to have a Science Fiction Rockband on tour.

      The Tour would be titled Apollo 85, cause the Flight 666 was a homage to the 1985 tour. In lore, it's because the Tour was done in 2085.

## Page 5 - I stopped paying attention until it was done

  + I did nothing for an entire week on GAMA.

  + I want to start the retrospective now.

## Page 6 - Someday

  Yes I am thinking about the _Someday song from The World Ends With You_

  I also just realized the importance of fresh air where I work. It makes invisible things clearer in the sense that even if I am not thinking about anything in particular at the moment, I feel my mind lighter and it is easier to think. The flow of my thoughts is intertwined with the wind I feel in my skin.

  My mind doesn't feel tired anymore. Well, the coffee might have helped.

  *My biggest problems right now are*

  + My discipline

    I am still horrible at *creating* and *keeping track* of habits. Such as writting here, working regularly on projects. My mind feels tired when I am not on coffee.

  + My lack of stopping to think alone

  + My focus / concentration

  *Missions*

  I've gotta create a simple way of keeping track of my stuff and think about it regularly.

  Description: I am living like I am on vacation. I am still at High School on life (22 years old). This is when I build the man I will be at 30, and there is nothing serious to it yet. I am living it like a vacation when I am in fact, very far from it.

## Page 7 - Coloring and Noting

  **Fast Coloring:** 

    1. Grayscale and Color Layer / Alternatively just flat

    2. Multiply layer for shadows - Select color and don't change anything. Maybe shift the HUE.

    3. Overlay layer for highlights - Again, don't change anything. May shift hue or choose white in some cases.

    4. Color Dodge for added Saturation and effects.

  **About note taking:**

    I still haven't figured out a way to:

      + Make a schedule I can easily pull up and alter from anywhere or not forget exists.

      + Keep track of something I am learning - projects, plans.

    For the schedule part, *I obviously need a calendar*. I should stop depending on my cellphone to organize my day.

    I should have the entire day inside my head once I read it.

    For the tracking part, *I need something akin to a notebook*. This vim file is the farthest I've come to something Like that. Maybe I already found one solution.

    Do I wanna draw when I take notes? Yes! Then how am I gonna do this on vim?
    
    Should I default to notebooks? They are very practical. Yes!

    I will take notes on a notebook.

  ***About this Repo*** 

    There are stories and a Diary I keep.

    This has been the best way to keep a diary here up until now. The pages don't feel organized nor easy to read inside the file itself, although in a **rendered markdown** view it looks decent. Still no images.
