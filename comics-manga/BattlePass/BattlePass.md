- **Normie**: Hey guys, what are you talking about?

- A battle pass!

- **Normie**: What's that?

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: It's what I live for.

- **Casual**: He was just explaining it.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: As I was saying, it is a reward system in the most popular games. It rewards you prizes for simply playing.

- **Casual**: Sound fun!

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: It's not. I've been playing non-stop in my free time and didn't even get halfway through. I just quit my job to finish it.

- **Normie**: WHAT!? WHY!?

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: Well, it was more of a firing, cause didn't have the time for it.

- **Normie**: Wtf does that mean? Of course you do.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: No I don't, I only managed to level up once a day, and it ends in a month. I still need 60 levels, so 60 days, which I didn't had.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: But now that I'm unemployed, I can finish it in 20 days, just before they cut the electricity in my house.

- **Normie**: That is madness.

- **Casual**: Sounds Hardcore.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: Thanks.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: What do you say CASUAL? Wanna grind the Battle Pass too?

- **Casual**: No man, I can't.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: Why?

- **Casual**: I already bought it. It unlocked everything instantly. Lucky me, it ends today.

- **Hardcore-Gamer**: Wait what day is-.
