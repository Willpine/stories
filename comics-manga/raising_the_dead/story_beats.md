It takes place at Maple District Founder's High School.

Principal raises class from the grave with a ritual.

3 mistfits investigate it. REMEMBER THEY ARE DUMB, or at least, impressionable. They are kids, don't make them too keen at first, only after investigating.

Jordan, Mike, Lucy.

It takes place over 3 weeks.

First week: Coincidences spike. Deja-vu, luck, instant karma.

Second week: Illusions, sightings, disappearances, loss of memory.

Third week: Bad aura around school. Animals behaving erratically, people feel strange passing by. Children see strange people near or inside the building.

## Chapter 1 - Lucy's Routine

Lucy wakes up, has her breakfast, boards the school bus and arrives at Maple District Founder's High School.

Both girls go to Professor Neil's pseudo class. Everyone, including him, are chatting, without anything being teach.

At the end of the school day, she goes home.

She feels sleepy and goes straight to bed.

## Chapter 2 - First strange happenings / Jordan Introduced

She has a strange dream connected to the first.

Same routine, but this time Kath has a streak of bad luck.

On the halls, certain people seem worried.

Lucy asks Kath about this, she says maybe it's puberty finally claiming their first victims.

While looking at them, they hear a scream and run to see what happened.

Someone is crying next to a skinny boy in a white hood.

Hall monitor comes up with the principal asking what happened and the kid is in shock while the other one says he saw nothing. The kid simply jumped to his side and fell.

## Chapter 10 - Find out it is the Principal right before finding her - Dahlia on the Ritual

Lucy, Jordan and Mike confront Dahlia at the old library.

They try stopping her with the sealing spell but it fails.

They talk to her explaining they understand her initial intentions were pure and only wanted to fix things up, but then it became tainted with the possibility of doing even more.

She hesitates for a moment and considers her options.

Then Dahlia says they would be right, her initial plan was to change their fate by removing her from the story, by erasing her conception, trading her time. **However**, she found out another way.

She can bring them back by trading over other people's moments. This way, she can change the fate of everyone. By sacrificing other people's fate.

Lucy gets furious and asks if that's what Dahlia's classmates would've wanted. If that's what Clara would have wanted.

    - You promissed so much to so many people, and yet, you are going to    destroy everything, fail them again, so you can feel better.

Time stood still for a moment to Dahlia.

She relinquishes the ritual, losing control.

    - You saved me.

Lucy hugs Dahlia.

    - I'm so glad you're back to us.

She says crying.

    - You know Lucy, the sad thing is that it is not gonna stop even after    this. It will take away everything I promised. I am so sorry. I th-

Said Dahlia just before she fainted.

Lucy remembers they can still overcharge the ritual.

They play the music louder and start throwing books at the Circle while adding objects to the sacrificial pillars.

The dead walk toward the circle.

After Clara enters it, the ritual finally ends.
