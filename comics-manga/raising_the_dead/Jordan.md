# Jordan

## Lucy's initial notes

The kid in the white hood.

He is skinny, about 1,70m.

Doesn't seem chatting with anyone. Mostly keeps to himself all day.

He reads horror comics and has a strange book in his backpack.

His face is pale and has a perpetual grin that persists even when he is yawning.

Lives around Umbral Vila.
