## Tracking my progress

I am trully in doubt of what exactly I should do now, and where all these notes should go.

The most reliable thing for me is to check on my other notes apart from when I am writing on them. Give it a moment or two between writting and remembering.

Remembering my day is momething I rarely do, which results in me being awful at tracking my progress in whatever. I should stop to read what I write more often.
